QOCCM
========

QOCCM (Quick Ocean Carbon Cycle Model) is a powerful one-dimensional ocean carbon cycle model. QOCCM is accurate -- models just like QOCCM are used to emulate the behavior of complex Earth System Models. And QOCCM is quick -- generating hundreds of years of ocean carbon cycle simulation in seconds on a laptop.

The QOCCM package includes code for running idealized experiments such as ocean uptake with fixed buffer capacity. See :doc:`Methodology <methodology>` for details. Please cite Ridge and McKinley (2020) if you use these idealized experiments in your own research.
